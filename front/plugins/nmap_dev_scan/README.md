## Overview

NMAP-scan is a command-line tool to discover and fingerprint IP hosts on the local network. The NMAP-scan (and other Network-scan plugin times using the `SCAN_SUBNETS` setting) time depends on the number of IP addresses to check so set this up carefully with the appropriate network mask and interface. Check the [subnets documentation](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/docs/SUBNETS.md) for help with setting up VLANs, what VLANs are supported, or how to figure out the network mask and your interface. 

> [!NOTE]
> The `NMAPDEV` plugin is great for detecting the availability of devices, however ARP scan might be better covering multiple VLANS. You can always combine different scan methods. You can find all available network scanning options (marked as `üîç dev scanner`) in the [Plugins overview](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/front/plugins/README.md) readme.  

### Usage

- Go to settings and set the `SCAN_SUBNETS` setting as per [subnets documentation](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/docs/SUBNETS.md).
- Enable the plugin by changing the RUN parameter from disabled to your preferred run time (usually: `schedule`).
  - Specify the schedule in the `NMAPDEV_RUN_SCHD` setting
- Adjust the timeout if needed in the `NMAPDEV_RUN_TIMEOUT` setting
- Review remaining settings
- SAVE
- Wait for the next scan to finish

## How it works
The system continuously scans the network for:
  - New devices
  - New connections (re-connections)
  - Disconnections
  - "Always Connected" devices down
  - Devices IP changes
  - Internet IP address changes

## Scan Methods
Up to three scanning methods are used:
  - **Method 1: arp-scan**. The arp-scan system utility is used to search
        for devices on the network using arp frames.
  - **Method 2: Pi-hole**. This method is optional and complementary to
        method 1. If the Pi-hole DNS server is active, Pi.Alert examines its
        activity looking for active devices using DNS that have not been
        detected by method 1.
  - **Method 3. dnsmasq**. This method is optional and complementary to the
        previous methods. If the DHCP server dnsmasq is active, Pi.Alert
        examines the DHCP leases (addresses assigned) to find active devices
        that were not discovered by the other methods.

# Installation
<!--- --------------------------------------------------------------------- --->
Initially designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, probably it can run on many other
Linux distributions.

> ‚ö† Please note, this [fork (jokob-sk)](https://github.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert) is only tested via the [docker install method](dockerfiles/README.md). Check out [leiweibau's fork](https://github.com/leiweibau/Pi.Alert/) if you want to install Pi.Alert on the server directly.

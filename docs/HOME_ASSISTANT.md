# Overview

NetAlertX comes with MQTT support, allowing you to show all detected devices as devices in Home Assistant. It also supplies a collection of stats, such as number of online devices.

> [!TIP]
> You can install NetAlertX also as a Home Assistant addon [![Home Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-blue?logo=home-assistant&style=for-the-badge&color=0aa8d2&logoColor=fff&label=Add)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falexbelgium%2Fhassio-addons) via the [alexbelgium/hassio-addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/).

## âš  Note 

- Please note that discovery takes about ~10s per device.
- Deleting of devices is not handled automatically. Please use [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/) to delete devices in the broker (Home Assistant), if needed. 
- For optimization reasons, the devices are not always fully synchronized. You can delete Plugin objects as described in the [MQTT plugin](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/tree/main/front/plugins/_publisher_mqtt#forcing-an-update) docs to force a full synchronization.

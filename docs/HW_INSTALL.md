PiAlert will be installed in `home/pi/pialert/` and run on port number `20211`.

## CURL

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert/main/install/install.sh && sudo chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```

## WGET


```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert/main/install/install.sh -O install.sh && sudo chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```

These commands will download the `install.sh` script from the GitHub repository, make it executable with `chmod`, and then run it using `./install.sh`.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script.

# Workflow examples

Workflows in NetAlertX automate actions based on real-time events and conditions. Below are practical examples that demonstrate how to build automation using triggers, conditions, and actions.

## Un-archive devices if detected online

This workflow automatically unarchives a device if it was previously archived but has now been detected as online.

### üìã Use Case

Sometimes devices are manually archived (e.g., no longer expected on the network), but they reappear unexpectedly. This workflow reverses the archive status when such devices are detected during a scan.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Un-archive devices if detected online",
  "trigger": {
    "object_type": "Devices",
    "event_type": "update"
  },
  "conditions": [
    {
      "logic": "AND",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "field": "devIsArchived",
          "operator": "equals",
          "value": "1"
        },
        {
          "field": "devPresentLastScan",
          "operator": "equals",
          "value": "1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "update_field",
      "field": "devIsArchived",
      "value": "0"
    }
  ],
  "enabled": "Yes"
}
```

### üîç Explanation

    - Trigger: Listens for updates to device records.
    - Conditions:
        - `devIsArchived` is `1` (archived).
        - `devPresentLastScan` is `1` (device was detected in the latest scan).
    - Action: Updates the device to set `devIsArchived` to `0` (unarchived).

### ‚úÖ Result

Whenever a previously archived device shows up during a network scan, it will be automatically unarchived ‚Äî allowing it to reappear in your device lists and dashboards.

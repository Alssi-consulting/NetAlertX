# Debugging and troubleshooting

Please follow tips 1 - 4 to get a more detailed error. 

## 1. More Logging 

When debugging an issue always set the highest log level:

`LOG_LEVEL='trace'`

## 2. Surfacing errors when container restarts 

Start the container via the **terminal** with a command similar to this one:

```bash
docker run --rm --network=host \
  -v local/path/netalertx/config:/app/config \
  -v local/path/netalertx/db:/app/db \
  -e TZ=Europe/Berlin \
  -e PORT=20211 \
  jokobsk/netalertx:latest

```

> ⚠ Please note, don't use the `-d` parameter so you see the error when the container crashes. Use this error in your issue description.

## 3. Check the _dev image and open issues 

If possible, check if your issue got fixed in the `_dev` image before opening a new issue. The container is:

`ghcr.io/jokob-sk/netalertx-dev:latest`

> ⚠ Please backup your DB and config beforehand!

Please also search [open issues](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/issues).

## 4. Disable restart behavior 

To prevent a Docker container from automatically restarting in a Docker Compose file, specify the restart policy as `no`:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  your-service:
    image: your-image:tag
    restart: no
    # Other service configurations...
```

## 5. Sharing application state

Sometimes specific log sections are needed to debug issues. The Devices and CurrentScan table data is sometimes needed to figure out what's wrong. 

1. Please set `LOG_LEVEL` to `trace` (Disable it once you have the info as this produces big log files).
2. Wait for the issue to occur.
3. Search for `================ DEVICES table content  ================` in your logs.
4. Search for `================ CurrentScan table content  ================` in your logs.
5. Open a new issue and post (redacted) output into the issue description (or send to the netalertx@gmail.com email if sensitive data present).
6. Please set `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` or lower.
